# BerryPeek Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2025-10-15

## Overview

BerryPeek is a browser extension that provides link previews via an overlay when you use Shift+Click. We designed BerryPeek to operate entirely on-device. It does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any user data.

## Data Collection

- **No collection:** BerryPeek does not collect any personal information, browsing history, page contents, cookies, or identifiers.
- **No tracking:** BerryPeek does not use analytics, telemetry, or profiling.
- **No storage:** BerryPeek does not persist logs or data locally beyond transient runtime state required to render the preview overlay.

## Data Sharing

- **No sharing:** BerryPeek does not share any data with third parties, advertising platforms, data brokers, or affiliates.
- **No ads:** The extension does not display ads or inject affiliate links.

## Permissions Use

BerryPeek requests only the minimum permissions necessary to:

- Detect link interactions to open a preview overlay.
- Render an iframe-based preview within the current page context.

These permissions are used solely to provide the extension's single, user-facing feature. BerryPeek does not access or collect web browsing activity except as required to show the selected page inside the overlay, and it does not transmit this information outside your browser.

## Limited Use Statement

BerryPeek's functionality is confined to its single purpose: previewing links in an overlay. We do not transfer, use, or sell user data for personalized advertising, creditworthiness assessment, or any unrelated purposes.

## Security

- All operations run locally within the browser's extension sandbox.
- No authentication, payment, or sensitive data is handled by the extension.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, we will update the "Last updated" date and publish the revised policy. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance of the updated terms.
